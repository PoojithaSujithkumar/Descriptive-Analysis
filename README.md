📊 Descriptive Analysis

📌 Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The focus was on performing **Descriptive Analysis** to extract insights from the dataset using statistical summaries and exploration of categorical variables.

📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:
- Restaurant details across various cities and countries
- Cuisines offered
- Ratings and other numerical indicators

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

🔍 Workflow  
✅ Calculated statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns  
✅ Explored the distribution of categorical variables like `Country Code`, `City`, and `Cuisines`  
✅ Identified the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants  
✅ Visualized trends using bar plots and summary tables

📈 Results  
- Gained insights into the central tendencies and spread of numerical data  
- Identified the most common cuisines and cities in the dataset  
- Revealed trends that could influence business or marketing strategies

🚀 Key Learnings  
- Reinforced the value of descriptive statistics in understanding data  
- Improved my skills in categorical data analysis  
- Learned to summarize large datasets into actionable insights  

🌟 Acknowledgment
